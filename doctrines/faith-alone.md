_(The works of the law can't bring life)_	

### + Galatians 3:14 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)

## Romans 4:1-3 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)

_(Abraham’s works did not bring him glory before God. But rather, Abraham was counted righteous before God by his faith alone.)_
	
## Romans 4:4-5 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<4> Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. <5> But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.

_(Trying to be saved by your works yields debt not grace. If someone does no works but believes on Christ. That faith is counted to them for righteousness despite having no righteousness of their own.)_

<6> Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works, <7> saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. <8> Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin. <9> Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.		

_(Even King David believed God imputes righteousness to man without works being required. Those who believe on Christ have their iniquities forgiven. Their sins are covered. And from that point on the Lord will not impute sin unto them. Abraham was made righteous before God by his faith only.)_

## 1 Timothy 1:16 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<16> Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.

<6> But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.		

_(Your best attempts at righteousness are as a filthy rag. A filthy rag cannot save you. Your works cannot save you.)_
		
## Acts 26:18 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<18> to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.

<11> And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:

## 2 Timothy 3:15 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)

_(The way someone becomes sealed with the holy Spirit unto the redemption and glorification of their body is to believe on Jesus Christ.)_
		
## Romans 9:30 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<30> What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.		
_(Righteousness is attained by faith. Not our works.)_		
		
## Romans 9:30 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<30> What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.		
 _(Once someone has believed on Christ Jesus for salvation, it is the end of having to strive for salvation through your works. Because salvation is by faith alone in Christ alone. And your striving to keep God’s commands and abstain from sin is not salvific and cannot save you.)_
		
## Acts 15:7-9 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<7> And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe. <8> And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us; <9> and put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.	

_(Faith is what purifies our hearts.)	_	
		
## Romans 5:15-18 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<15> But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many. <16> And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification. <17> For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.) <18> Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.

_(The righteouness that is unto justification of life is a free gift that requires no works to receive.)_		
		
## Romans 10:6 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<6> But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)

_(Righteousness is received by faith. Not by works.)_	
		
## Romans 9:31-33 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<31> But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness. <32> Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone; <33> as it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.	

_(Israel tried to seek righteousness through the works of the law and failed because they didn’t seek righteousness through faith. And this faith is in Christ Jesus.)_
		
## Psalm 32:1-2 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<1> Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. <2> Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.		
<10> Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the Lord, mercy shall compass him about.	

_(King David is saying someone can have their transgression forgiven, sins covered, and have none of their iniquity imputed upon them by the LORD. And those that trust in the LORD shall receive mercy from Him. How did Paul interpret this? 👇)_

### + Romans 4:5-8 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<5> But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. <6> Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works, <7> saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. <8> Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.

_(According to Paul, King David is saying in Psalm 32 that someone can do no works but believe and be counted righteous before God by this faith alone. Paul is saying that Psalm 32 is teaching that having your transgressions forgiven, sins covered, and having none of your iniquity imputed upon you can be attained without works and instead by faith alone.)_
		
## 1 John 5:1 & 4-5 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<1> Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.	
<4> For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. <5> Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?

_(The condition given to be born of God is to believe on Jesus Christ. Believing on Jesus Christ is what makes one overcome the world.)_		
		
## John 3:14-18 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<14> And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: <15> that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. <16> For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. <17> For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. <18> He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

_(The condition give for not perishing, having eternal life, and not being condemned is given three times in this passage. All three times we see faith alone is what makes someone not perish, have everlasting life, and not be condemned.)_	
		
## Hebrews 11:6 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<6> But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.	
_(To come to God you must believe that he is.)_	
		
## Acts 11:15-17 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<15> And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning. <16> Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost. <17> Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?	

_(The gift of the Holy Ghost is given by faith alone to them that believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.)_
		
## Romans 4:13 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<13> For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. 		
_(Righteousness is attained by faith and not by our adhering to the law.)_	
		
## Hebrews 4:2-3 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<2> For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it. <3> For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.

_(The gospel profits you by believing it. And you enter into rest by faith.)_

### + Hebrews 4:9-10 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<9> There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. <10> For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.

_(Those who have entered this rest by faith alone as verses 2-3 say have ceased from striving to have rest by their works because your works don’t merit or maintain this rest. Faith alone enters someone into this rest and keeps them in this rest.)_	
		
## Romans 10:10 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<10> For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.		

_(We attain righteousness by believing.)_
	
## Titus 3:5 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<5> not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;

_(Our works aren't involved in how we are saved.)_		
		
## Titus 3:8 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<8> This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.

_(Paul says that after someone have believed they should maintain good works. Why? Are they profitable unto salvation or eternal life? No, Paul says they’re good and profitable unto men. If works were salvific, Paul just missed a prime opportunity to say so considering he was talking about what works are profitable unto.)_
		
## Revelation 22:17 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<17> And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.		

_(Those who are thirsty can take the water of life freely without cost. This is a reference to the water of salvation.)_

### + Isaiah 12:3 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<3> Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.	

_(We can take from the wells of salvation freely.)_	

### + Isaiah 55:1 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<1> Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.		

_(We can buy salvation without money and price. Salvation costs us nothing. We can freely take the water of life through faith without works.)_
