<20> Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin. <21> But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; <22> even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:

him for salvation.)_

_(We are justified freely by God's grace. Meaning		
there is no cost to being justified before God. And		
this free justification is by faith in the Lord Jesus		
Christ.)_

<26> to declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. <27> Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith. <28> Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.	

_(God justifies those who believe on Jesus for 		
salvation. There is no boasting in the works of the		
law. They are not salvific and not meritorious for 		
justification.)	_

##### 1 John 3:4 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<4> Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.	

_(Man is justifed by faith alone before God without		
the deeds of the law. This includes abstaining from		
any sin for justification because all sin is 		
transgression of the law. To not transgress the law 		
is to be keeping the law and doing the deeds of 		
the law.)_	
		
#### Romans 3:29-30 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)

to believe on Jesus Christ.)	_	
		
#### Galatians 3:21-22 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<21> Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law. <22> But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.

_(The works of the law can't bring life)_	

##### Galatians 3:14 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<14> that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.

_(The promise by faith is the Spirit. Believing on		
Jesus Christ yields life and being given the		
Spirit. This cannot be done by works.)	_	
		
#### Galatians 3:6-8 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<6> Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness. <7> Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham. <8> And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed.		

_(Abraham was counted righteous before God 		
by his faith alone. Those who have believed 		
on Christ are the children of Abraham. The 		
heathen is justified before God by faith. Works		
aren't given as a condition to being justified before		
God.)	_	
		
#### Galatians 3:11 & 14 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<11> But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.	
<14> that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
	

_(Nobody can be justified by the works of the law		
in God's sight. But the just live by faith and 		
receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.)_		
		
#### Galatians 3:24 & 26 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<24> Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.	
<26> For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.

_(We are justified by faith and become a child of 		
God by faith in Christ Jesus.)	_	
		
#### Galatians 3:2-3 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<2> This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? <3> Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?

_(You either receive the Spirit by works exclusively		
or faith exclusively. Not by having a combination		
of both.)_	

##### Galatians 3:14 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<14> that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.

_(Paul goes on to say that the Spirit is received 		
by faith on Jesus Christ. This is received 		
exclusively by faith alone.)	_	
		
#### John 7:38 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<38> He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water..	

_(The condition for having living water is to believe		
on Jesus Christ.)_		
		
#### Psalm 18:30 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<30> As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the Lord is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.	

_(The condition for having the Lord be your buckler		
that is your shield, protector, and defender is to 		
trust in him.)	_	
		
#### Acts 19:4 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<4> Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.
	

_(The gospel John the Baptist was preaching was		
that the people should believe on Christ Jesus 		
for salvation.)	_	
		
#### Hebrews 11:7 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<7> By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.	

_(Righteousness is attained by faith.)	_	
		
#### Romans 4:1-3 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<1> What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found? <2> For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God. <3> For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.	

_(Abraham's works did not bring him glory before		
God. But rather, Abraham was counted righteous		
before God by his faith alone.)	_	
		
#### Romans 4:4-5 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<4> Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. <5> But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.

_(Trying to be saved by your works yields debt		
not grace. If someone does no works but believes		
on Christ. That faith is counted to them for 		
righteousness despite having no righteousness		
of their own.)	_	
		
#### Romans 4:6-9 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<6> Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works, <7> saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. <8> Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin. <9> Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.		

_(Even King David believed God imputes 		
righteousness to man without works being required.		
Those who believe on Christ have their iniquities		
forgiven. Their sins are covered. And from that		
point on the Lord will not impute sin unto them. 		
Abraham was made righteous before God by		
his faith only.)	_	
		
#### 1 Timothy 1:16 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<16> Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting. 	

_(Believing on Christ is what yields salvation and		
everlasting life.)	_	
		
#### 1 Timothy 4:10 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<10> For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.	

_(God saves those that believe on him.)	_	
		
#### Isaiah 64:6 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<6> But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.		

_(Your best attempts at righteousness are as a 		
filthy rag. A filthy rag cannot save you. Your works		
cannot save you.)_		
		
#### Acts 26:18 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<18> to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.	

_(To be sanctified means to be made holy and 		
purified. Jesus tells Paul that people are made 		
holy and purified by having faith in Jesus Christ.)	_	
		
#### Romans 4:11 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<11> And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:

_(Abraham was righteous in God's sight by his		
faith alone. Everyone else who believes 		
receives imputed righteousness unto them also		
just like Abraham.)_	
		
#### 2 Timothy 3:15 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<15> and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.

_(Salvation is through faith in Christ Jesus.)_	
		
#### Ephesians 1:12-14 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<12> that we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ. <13> in whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, <14> which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.	

_(The way someone becomes sealed with the 		
holy Spirit unto the redemption and glorification 		
of their body is to believe on Jesus Christ.)_	
		
#### Romans 9:30 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<30> What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.		
_(Righteousness is attained by faith. Not our works.)_		
		
#### Romans 9:30 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<30> What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.		
_(Once someone has believed on Christ Jesus 		
for salvation, it is the end of having to strive for 		
salvation through your works. Because salvation 		
is by faith alone in Christ alone. And your striving		
to keep God's commands and abstain from sin 		
is not salvific and cannot save you.)	_	
		
#### Acts 15:7-9 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<7> And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe. <8> And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us; <9> and put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.	

_(Faith is what purifies our hearts.)	_	
		
#### Romans 5:15-18 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<15> But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many. <16> And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification. <17> For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.) <18> Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.

_(The righteouness that is unto justification of life		
is a free gift that requires no works to receive.)_		
		
#### Romans 10:6 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<6> But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)

_(Righteousness is received by faith. Not by works.)	_	
		
#### Romans 9:31-33 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<31> But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness. <32> Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone; <33> as it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.	

_(Israel tried to seek righteousness through the 		
works of the law and failed because they didn't 		
seek righteousness through faith. And this faith		
is in Christ Jesus.)		_
		
#### Psalm 32:1-2 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<1> Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. <2> Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.		
<10> Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the Lord, mercy shall compass him about.	

_(King David is saying someone can have their 		
transgression forgiven, sins covered, and have		
none of their iniquity imputed upon them by the		
LORD. And those that trust in the LORD shall 		
receive mercy from Him. How did Paul interpret 		
this?)		_

##### Romans 4:5-8 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<5> But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. <6> Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works, <7> saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. <8> Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.

_(According to Paul, King David is saying in 		
Psalm 32 that someone can do no works but 		
believe and be counted righteous before God by		
this faith alone. Paul is saying that Psalm 32 is		
teaching that having your transgressions forgiven, 		
sins covered, and having none of your iniquity 		
imputed upon you can be attained without works 		
and instead by faith alone.)		_
		
#### 1 John 5:1 & 4-5 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<1> Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.	
<4> For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. <5> Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?

_(The condition given to be born of God is to believe 		
on Jesus Christ. Believing on Jesus Christ is 		
what makes one overcome the world.)_		
		
#### John 3:14-18 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<14> And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: <15> that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. <16> For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. <17> For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. <18> He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

_(The condition give for not perishing, having 		
eternal life, and not being condemned is given		
three times in this passage. All three times we 		
see faith alone is what makes someone not 		
perish, have everlasting life, and not be 		
condemned.)_		
		
#### Hebrews 11:6 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<6> But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.	
_(To come to God you must believe that he is.)	_	
		
#### Acts 11:15-17 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<15> And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning. <16> Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost. <17> Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?	

_(The gift of the Holy Ghost is given by faith alone		
to them that believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.)	__	
		
#### Romans 4:13 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<13> For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. 		
_(Righteousness is attained by faith and not by 		
our adhering to the law.)	_	
		
#### Hebrews 4:2-3 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<2> For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it. <3> For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.

_(The gospel profits you by believing it. And you 		
enter into rest by faith.)_

##### Hebrews 4:9-10 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<9> There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. <10> For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.

_(Those who have entered this rest by faith alone		
as verses 2-3 say have ceased from striving to		
have rest by their works because your works 		
don't merit or maintain this rest. Faith alone 		
enters someone into this rest and keeps them in		
this rest.)_		
		
#### Romans 10:10 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<10> For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.		

_(We attain righteousness by believing.)		_
		
#### Titus 3:5 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<5> not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;

_(Our works aren't involved in how we are saved.)_		
		
#### Titus 3:8 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<8> This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.

_(Paul says that after someone have believed they		
should maintain good works. Why? Are they 		
profitable unto salvation or eternal life? No, Paul		
says they're good and profitable unto men. If 		
works were salvific, Paul just missed a prime 		
opportunity to say so considering he was talking		
about what works are profitable unto.)	_	
		
#### Revelation 22:17 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<17> And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.		

_(Those who are thirsty can take the water of life		
freely without cost. This is a reference to the 		
water of salvation.)	_	

##### Isaiah 12:3 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<3> Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.	

_(We can take from the wells of salvation freely.)_	

##### Isaiah 55:1 - Authorized (King James) Version (AKJV)
<1> Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.		

_(We can buy salvation without money and price. 		
Salvation costs us nothing. We can freely take 		
the water of life through faith without works.)	_
