Romans 5:1-2 		
1 Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace		
with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: 2 By 		
whom also we have access by faith into this grace		
wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory		
of God.		
(Believers are justified before God by faith. 		
Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ brings us 		
peace with God. Faith alone give us access into		
the grace of God.)

him for righteousness: and he was called the 		
Friend of God.

John 1:12-13		
12 But as many as received him, to them gave he		
power to become the sons of God, even to them		
that believe on his name: 13 Which were born, not		
of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will 		
of man, but of God.		
(Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ makes 		
someone become born of God. Faith alone is 		
all that's required to become a child of God.)		
		
John 3:36		
36 He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting		
life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see

believing on Jesus for salvation. And unbelief 		
is the cause of God's wrath being upon you.)

righteousness but instead through faith in Him.)

24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that heareth my 		
word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath 		
everlasting life, and shall not come into

is what causes someone to pass from death unto		
life.)		
		
Acts 10:43		
43 To him give all the prophets witness, that 		
through his name whosoever believeth in him 		
shall receive remission of sins.		
(Remission of sins is attained by faith alone on

4 Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright		
in him: but the just shall live by his faith.		
(The just live by their faith.)		
		
Nahum 1:7		
7 The LORD is good, a strong hold in the day of		
trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him. 		
(The condition to the LORD knowing someone		
is if they trust in him.)		
		
John 8:24 		
24 I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in 		
your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye		
shall die in your sins.		
(The condition Jesus gives to not dying in your 		
sins is to believe on him for salvation.)		
		
1 Peter 1:5 		
5 Who are kept by the power of God through faith		
unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last 		
time.		
(Faith is the condition given to being kept by God's		
power unto salvation.)		
		
Acts 13:39 		
39 And by him all that believe are justified from all		
things, from which ye could not be justified by the 		
law of Moses.		
(All that believe on Jesus Christ are justified from		
all things. And you cannot be justified by keeping 		
the works of the law.)		
		
Acts 16:30-31		
30 And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what 		
must I do to be saved? 31 And they said, Believe 		
on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved,		
and thy house. 		
(Paul and Silas say the requirement for being 		
saved is believing on the Lord Jesus Christ.)		
		
Luke 8:12		
12 Those by the way side are they that hear; then		
cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out		
of their hearts, lest they should believe and be 		
saved.		
(Jesus says the seed received by the way side 		
would be saved if they believe.)		
		
John 20:31		
31 But these are written, that ye might believe that		
Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that 		
believing ye might have life through his name.		
(Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ brings life.)		
		
Romans 1:16-17		
16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ:		
for it is the power of God unto salvation to every 		
one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to		
the Greek. 17 For therein is the righteousness of 		
God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, 		
The just shall live by faith. 		
(The gospel is the power of God unto salvation. 		
believe on Jesus Christ. And the just live by faith.)		
		
1 Corinthians 1:21 		
21 For after that in the wisdom of God the world 		
by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the 		
foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. 		
(We are saved through our belief.)		
		
Romans 11:6 		
6 And if by grace, then is it no more of works: 		
otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of 		
works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work 		
is no more work. 		
(You can't have salvation by grace and by works.		
It's either all by grace or all by works. To say that		
salvation is by faith and works contradict this. It's		
one or the other.)		
		
Romans 3:20-22		
20 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall		
no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is 		
the knowledge of sin. 21 But now the 		
righteousness of God without the law is 		
manifested, being witnessed by the law and the		
prophets; 22 Even the righteousness of God which		
is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all 		
them that believe: for there is no difference: 		
(Nobody can be justified in God's sight by doing		
the deeds of the law.)		
1 John 3:4		
4 Whosoever commiteth sin transgresseth also		
the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.		
(All sin is the transgression of the law. No amount		
of obstaining from sin can justify you before God		
because to obstain from sin is to do the deeds of 		
the law. But the righteousness of God is attained 		
by faith of Christ alone on all them that believe on		
him for salvation.)		
		
Romans 3:23-25		
23 For all have sinned, and come short of the 		
glory of God; 24 Being justified freely by his grace		
through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: 25 		
Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation 		
through faith in his blood, to declare his 		
righteousness for the remission of sins that are 		
past, through the forbearance of God;		
(We are justified freely by God's grace. Meaning		
there is no cost to being justified before God. And		
this free justification is by faith in the Lord Jesus		
Christ.)		
		
Romans 3:26-28 		
26 To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness:		
that he might be just, and the justifier of him which		
believeth in Jesus. 27 Where is boasting then?		
It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but 		
by the law of faith. 28 Therefore we conclude that 		
a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the		
law.		
(God justifies those who believe on Jesus for 		
salvation. There is no boasting in the works of the		
law. They are not salvific and not meritorious for 		
justification.)		
1 John 3:4		
4 Whosoever commiteth sin transgresseth also		
the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.		
(Man is justifed by faith alone before God without		
the deeds of the law. This includes abstaining from		
any sin for justification because all sin is 		
transgression of the law. To not transgress the law 		
is to be keeping the law and doing the deeds of 		
the law.)		
		
Romans 3:29-30 		
29 Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also		
of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also: 30 		
Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the 		
circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through		
faith.		
(The means by which all men are justified before		
God is faith alone.)		
		
John 6:35		
35 And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of 		
life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and 		
he that believeth on me shall never thirst.		
(The condition given to never thirsting spiritually is 		
to believe on Jesus Christ.)		
		
John 11:25-27 		
25 Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and 		
the life: he that believeth in me, though he were 		
dead, yet shall he live: 26 And whosoever liveth 		
and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou 		
this? 27 She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe 		
that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which 		
should come into the world. 		
(The condition given for living and never dying is 		
to believe on Jesus Christ.)		
		
Galatians 3:21-22		
21 Is the law then against the promises of God? 		
God forbid: for if there had been a law given 		
which could have given life, verily righteousness		
should have been by the law. 22 But the scripture		
hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by		
faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them		
that believe.		
(The works of the law can't bring life)		
Galatians 3:14		
14 That the blessing of Abraham might come 		
on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we 		
might receive the promise of the Spirit through		
faith.		
(The promise by faith is the Spirit. Believing on		
Jesus Christ yields life and being given the		
Spirit. This cannot be done by works.)		
		
Galatians 3:6-8		
6 Even as Abraham believed God, and it was 		
accounted to him for righteousness. 7 Know ye 		
therefore that they which are of faith, the same are 		
the children of Abraham. 8 And the scripture, 		
forseeing that God would justify the heathen 		
through faith, preached before the gospel unto 		
Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be 		
blessed. 		
(Abraham was counted righteous before God 		
by his faith alone. Those who have believed 		
on Christ are the children of Abraham. The 		
heathen is justified before God by faith. Works		
aren't given as a condition to being justified before		
God.)		
		
Galatians 3:11 & 14		
11 But that no man is justified by the law in the 		
sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by		
faith. 		
14 That the blessing of Abraham might come on		
the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might		
receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.		
(Nobody can be justified by the works of the law		
in God's sight. But the just live by faith and 		
receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.)		
		
Galatians 3:24 & 26		
24 Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to 		
bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by 		
faith. 		
26 For ye are all the children of God by faith in 		
Christ Jesus.		
(We are justified by faith and become a child of 		
God by faith in Christ Jesus.)		
		
Galatians 3:2-3		
2 This only would I learn of you, Received ye the 		
Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of		
faith? 3 Are ye so foolish? having begun in the 		
Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?		
(You either receive the Spirit by works exclusively		
or faith exclusively. Not by having a combination		
of both.)		
Galatians 3:14		
14 That the blessing of Abraham might come 		
on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we 		
might receive the promise of the Spirit through		
faith.		
(Paul goes on to say that the Spirit is received 		
by faith on Jesus Christ. This is received 		
exclusively by faith alone.)		
		
John 7:38 		
38 He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath		
said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.		
(The condition for having living water is to believe		
on Jesus Christ.)		
		
Psalm 18:30		
30 As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the		
LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all those that 		
trust in him.		
(The condition for having the Lord be your buckler		
that is your shield, protector, and defender is to 		
trust in him.)		
		
Acts 19:4		
4 Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the 		
baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, 		
that they should believe on him which should 		
come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.		
(The gospel John the Baptist was preaching was		
that the people should believe on Christ Jesus 		
for salvation.)		
		
Hebrews 11:7		
7 By faith Noah, being warned of God of things 		
not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an 		
ark to the saving of his house; by the which he		
condemned the world, and became heir of the		
righteousness which is by faith.		
(Righteousness is attained by faith.)		
		
Romans 4:1-3		
1 What shall we say then that Abraham our 		
father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found? 2 		
For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath		
whereof to glory; but not before God. 3 For what		
saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it		
was counted unto him for righteousness.		
(Abraham's works did not bring him glory before		
God. But rather, Abraham was counted righteous		
before God by his faith alone.)		
		
Romans 4:4-5		
4 Now to him that worketh is the reward not 		
reckoned of grace, but of debt. 5 But to him that		
worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth 		
the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.		
(Trying to be saved by your works yields debt		
not grace. If someone does no works but believes		
on Christ. That faith is counted to them for 		
righteousness despite having no righteousness		
of their own.)		
		
Romans 4:6-9		
6 Even as David also describeth the blessedness		
of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness		
without works. 7 Saying, Blessed are they whose 		
iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.		
8 Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not		
impute sin. 9 Cometh this blessedness then upon		
the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision		
also? for we say that faith was reckoned to 		
Abraham for righteousness.		
(Even King David believed God imputes 		
righteousness to man without works being required.		
Those who believe on Christ have their iniquities		
forgiven. Their sins are covered. And from that		
point on the Lord will not impute sin unto them. 		
Abraham was made righteous before God by		
his faith only.)		
		
1 Timothy 1:16		
16 Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in 		
me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all 		
longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should 		
hereafter believe on him to life everlasting. 		
(Believing on Christ is what yields salvation and		
everlasting life.)		
		
1 Timothy 4:10 		
10 For therefore we both labour and suffer 		
reproach, because we trust in the living God, who 		
is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that		
believe.		
(God saves those that believe on him.)		
		
Isaiah 64:6		
6 But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our		
righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do		
fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind,		
have taken us away.		
(Your best attempts at righteousness are as a 		
filthy rag. A filthy rag cannot save you. Your works		
cannot save you.)		
		
Acts 26:18		
18 To open their eyes, and to turn them from 		
darkness to light, and from the power of Satan 		
unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of		
sins, and inheritance among them which are 		
sanctified by faith that is in me.		
(To be sanctified means to be made holy and 		
purified. Jesus tells Paul that people are made 		
holy and purified by having faith in Jesus Christ.)		
		
Romans 4:11		
11 And he received the sign of circumcision, a 		
seal of righteousness of the faith which he had 		
yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the 		
father of all them that believe, though they be not		
circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed		
unto them also:		
(Abraham was righteous in God's sight by his		
faith alone. Everyone else who believes 		
receives imputed righteousness unto them also		
just like Abraham.)		
		
2 Timothy 3:15 		
15 And that from a child thou hast known the holy 		
scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto		
salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.		
(Salvation is through faith in Christ Jesus.)		
		
Ephesians 1:12-14		
12 That we should be the praise of his glory, who 		
first trusted in Christ. 13 In whom ye also trusted, 		
after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of 		
your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, 		
ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, 		
14 Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the 		
redemption of the purchased possession, unto the 		
praise of his glory. 		
(The way someone becomes sealed with the 		
holy Spirit unto the redemption and glorification 		
of their body is to believe on Jesus Christ.)		
		
Romans 9:30		
30 What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, 		
which followed not after righteousness, have 		
attained to righteousness, even the righteousness		
which is of faith. 		
(Righteousness is attained by faith. Not our works.)		
		
Romans 10:4 		
4 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness		
to every one that believeth. 		
(Once someone has believed on Christ Jesus 		
for salvation, it is the end of having to strive for 		
salvation through your works. Because salvation 		
is by faith alone in Christ alone. And your striving		
to keep God's commands and abstain from sin 		
is not salvific and cannot save you.)		
		
Acts 15:7-9		
7 And when there had been much disputing, Peter		
rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, 		
ye know how that a good while ago God made 		
choice among us, that the Gentiles by mouth 		
should hear the word of the gospel, and believe. 8 		
And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them 		
withess, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he 		
did unto us; 9 And put no difference between us 		
and them, purifying their hearts by faith. 		
(Faith is what purifies our hearts.)		
		
Romans 5:15-18		
15 But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. 		
For if through the offence of one many be dead, 		
much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace 		
, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath 		
abounded unto many. 16 And not as it was by one		
that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgement was by		
one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many 		
offences unto justification. 17 For if by one man's 		
offence death reigned by one; much more they 		
which receive abundance of grace and of the gift		
of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus 		
Christ.) 18 Therefore as by the offence of one		
judgement came upon all men to condemnation; 		
even so by the righteousness of one the free gift 		
came upon all men unto justification of life.		
(The righteouness that is unto justification of life		
is a free gift that requires no works to receive.)		
		
Romans 10:6		
6 But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh		
on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall 		
ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down		
from above:)		
(Righteousness is received by faith. Not by works.)		
		
Romans 9:31-33		
31 But Israel, which followed after the law of 		
righteousness, hath not attained to the law of 		
righteousness. 32 Wherefore? Because they 		
sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works		
of the law. For they stumbled at that 		
stumblingstone; 33 As it is written, Behold, I lay		
in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and		
whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.		
(Israel tried to seek righteousness through the 		
works of the law and failed because they didn't 		
seek righteousness through faith. And this faith		
is in Christ Jesus.)		
		
Psalm 32:1-2 & 10		
1 Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, 		
whose sin is covered. 2 Blessed is the man unto		
whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in 		
whose spirit there is no guile. 		
10 Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he		
that trusteth in the LORD, mercy shall compass		
him about. 		
(King David is saying someone can have their 		
transgression forgiven, sins covered, and have		
none of their iniquity imputed upon them by the		
LORD. And those that trust in the LORD shall 		
receive mercy from Him. How did Paul interpret 		
this?)		
Romans 4:5-8		
5 But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him		
that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for		
righteousness. 6 Even as David also describeth 		
the blessedness of the man, unto whom God 		
imputeth righteousness without works, 7 Saying,		
Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven,		
and whose sins are covered. 8 Blessed is the 		
man to whom the Lord will not impute sin. 		
(According to Paul, King David is saying in 		
Psalm 32 that someone can do no works but 		
believe and be counted righteous before God by		
this faith alone. Paul is saying that Psalm 32 is		
teaching that having your transgressions forgiven, 		
sins covered, and having none of your iniquity 		
imputed upon you can be attained without works 		
and instead by faith alone.)		
		
1 John 5:1 & 4-5		
1 Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ		
is born of God: and every one that loveth him 		
that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.		
4 For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the		
world: and this is the victory that overcometh		
the world, even our faith. 5 Who is he that 		
overcometh the world, but he that believeth that		
Jesus is the Son of God?		
(The condition given to be born of God is to believe 		
on Jesus Christ. Believing on Jesus Christ is 		
what makes one overcome the world.)		
		
John 3:14-18 		
14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the 		
wilderness, even so must the Son of man be 		
lifted up: 15 That whosoever believeth in him 		
should not perish, but have eternal life. 16 For		
God so loved the world, that he gave his only 		
begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him		
should not perish, but have everlasting life. 17 		
For God sent not his Son into the world to 		
condemn the world; but that the world through him		
might be saved. 18 He that believeth on him is		
not condemned: but he that believeth not is 		
condemned already, because he hath not 		
believed in the name of the only begotten Son		
of God. 		
(The condition give for not perishing, having 		
eternal life, and not being condemned is given		
three times in this passage. All three times we 		
see faith alone is what makes someone not 		
perish, have everlasting life, and not be 		
condemned.)		
		
Hebrews 11:6		
6 But without faith it is impossible to please him:		
for he that cometh to God must believe that he 		
is, and that he is a rewarder of them that 		
diligently seek him. 		
(To come to God you must believe that he is.)		
		
Acts 11:15-17		
15 And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on 		
them, as on us at the beginning. 16 Then 		
remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he		
said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye 		
shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost. 17 		
Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift 		
as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus		
Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God? 		
(The gift of the Holy Ghost is given by faith alone		
to them that believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.)		
		
Romans 4:13		
13 For the promise, that he should be the heir of		
the world, was not to Abraham , or to his seed, 		
through the law, but through the righteousness of		
faith. 		
(Righteousness is attained by faith and not by 		
our adhering to the law.)		
		
Hebrews 4:2-3		
2 For unto us was the gospel preached, as well		
as unto them: but the word preached did not profit		
them, not being mixed with faith in them that 		
heard it. 3 For we which have believed do 		
enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my		
wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although 		
the works were finished from the foundation of 		
the world. 		
(The gospel profits you by believing it. And you 		
enter into rest by faith.)		
Hebrews 4:9-10 		
9 There remaineth therefore a rest to the people 		
of God. 10 For he that is entered into his rest, 		
he also hath ceased from his own works, as God		
did from his. 		
(Those who have entered this rest by faith alone		
as verses 2-3 say have ceased from striving to		
have rest by their works because your works 		
don't merit or maintain this rest. Faith alone 		
enters someone into this rest and keeps them in		
this rest.)		
		
Romans 10:10		
10 For with the heart man believeth unto 		
righteousness; and with the mouth confession is 		
made unto salvation.		
(We attain righteousness by believing.)		
		
Titus 3:5		
5 Not by works of righteousness which we have 		
done, but according to his mercy he saved us,		
by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of		
the Holy Ghost;		
(Our works aren't involved in how we are saved.)		
		
Titus 3:8		
8 This is a faithful saying, and these things I will		
that thou affirm constantly, that they which have 		
believed in God might be careful to maintain good		
works. These things are good profitable unto men.		
(Paul says that after someone have believed they		
should maintain good works. Why? Are they 		
profitable unto salvation or eternal life? No, Paul		
says they're good and profitable unto men. If 		
works were salvific, Paul just missed a prime 		
opportunity to say so considering he was talking		
about what works are profitable unto.)		
		
Revelation 22:17		
17 And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let		
him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is		
athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take		
the water of life freely. 		
(Those who are thirsty can take the water of life		
freely without cost. This is a reference to the 		
water of salvation.)		
Isaiah 12:3		
3 Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the		
wells of salvation. 		
(We can take from the wells of salvation freely.)		
Isaiah 55:1		
1 Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the 		
waters, and he that hath no money; come ye,		
buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without		
money and without price. 		
(We can buy salvation without money and price. 		
Salvation costs us nothing. We can freely take 		
the water of life through faith without works.)
